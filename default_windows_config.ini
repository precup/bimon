; It's recommended to copy this file to your own config.ini and edit it there.

[General]
; The farthest back commit to cache.
; Also used as an early test point while bisecting.

; The path to the Godot repository to use.
; If the folder doesn't exist, BiMon can clone into it for you.
; Changing this value is not recommended.
; It is strongly recommended to let BiMon have its own godot repository.

[Compression]

; It is not recommended to change this value.

[Compilation]
; This name MUST match the name of the binary your compiler flags creates
; This varies for a variety of reasons and BiMon will fail to run if this is wrong.

; The rest of these settings are important because they impact speed, not correctness.
; You should experiment with flags outside of BiMon to find the best settings for your system.

; These settings require no extra dependencies and should work on any system.
; Just replace the platform with the correct one for your system.
